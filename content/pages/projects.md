The **Mark I Project** closes with a 15-minute-long group presentation and a written report from your group. The **Final Project** closes with a final 15-minute-long group presentation of the project in the last week of class, and a written report that is due on the last day of classes. The Mark I and Final Project reports and presentations are group efforts.

Again, all assigned work must be handed in to receive a grade.
